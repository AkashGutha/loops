## 🔁 Loops — lightweight flows that augment you, then scale out

Loops is a space for capturing and sharing lightweight, repeatable flows so you can stay responsible from start to finish. It helps you note where you are in a loop, update progress, close the loop confidently, and keep a clear record of what’s happening along the way. The goal is to augment an individual’s capabilities—letting you move faster with less overhead while remaining shareable.

### Why it matters
- 🚀 Reduces friction from idea to action by keeping knowledge, actions, and context together.
- 🧭 Lowers cognitive load so you can focus on creative work instead of wrangling details.
- 🔁 Encourages reuse over reinvention, so your personal workflows get sharper over time.

### Core concepts
- 🔐 Identity: sign in to personalize your workspace and keep your loops tied to you.
- ✏️ Creation: draft and publish new loops so you can reuse and refine your own flows.
- 🔎 Discovery: browse loops to quickly learn, adopt, or adapt what works.
- 🎯 Focused interaction: open an individual loop in a clean, distraction-light view.
- 📍 Status & closure: mark where you are in a loop, update it, and close it with confidence.
